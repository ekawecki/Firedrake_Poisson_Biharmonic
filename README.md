This repository contains code scripts for the numerical solution Poisson and biharmonic problem using a DGFEM.

The code scripts are implementable in the latest version of Firedrake, available here: https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html

The folder "Meshes" contains the meshes that are called in the code scripts. They have been generated in Gmsh: http://gmsh.info/
